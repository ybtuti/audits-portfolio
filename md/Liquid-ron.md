# Introduction

A time-boxed security review of the **Liquid Ron** protocol was done by **0xodus**, with a focus on the security aspects of the application's smart contracts implementation.

# Disclaimer

A smart contract security review can never verify the complete absence of vulnerabilities. This is a time, resource and expertise bound effort where I try to find as many vulnerabilities as possible. I can not guarantee 100% security after the review or even if the review will find any problems with your smart contracts. Subsequent security reviews, bug bounty programs and on-chain monitoring are strongly recommended.

# Severity classification

| Severity               | Impact: High | Impact: Medium | Impact: Low |
| ---------------------- | ------------ | -------------- | ----------- |
| **Likelihood: High**   | Critical     | High           | Medium      |
| **Likelihood: Medium** | High         | Medium         | Low         |
| **Likelihood: Low**    | Medium       | Low            | Low         |

**Impact** - the technical, economic and reputation damage of a successful attack

**Likelihood** - the chance that a particular vulnerability gets discovered and exploited

**Severity** - the overall criticality of the risk
